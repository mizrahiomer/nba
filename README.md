# React NBA App

This is a website app built using React Hooks and Redux, check All latest scores updates, teams and players details from the best league in the world.
The app is connected to Firebase Google authentication and Real-Time Database to save all your favorites by your google user.
I'm using [react-ticker](https://github.com/AndreasFaust/react-ticker/tree/master/example) to display all the latest score and [react-slick](https://react-slick.neostack.com/) to display teams fan-art.
The app is adapted for large screen size as well as for mobile screen size.

Check the live demo hosted on firebase [here](https://nba-app-7e573.firebaseapp.com/).
